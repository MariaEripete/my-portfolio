            <h3>Books! Books! Books!</h3>
            <p>The picture represents the fact that i like to read. I read many types of books but my favourite ones are romace novels, selfhelp books, crime and mystery novels. These are such different genres but i still enjoy them equally.</p>
            <p>I like to read books because it allow you to experience multiple realities. It is a great way to unwind when you have free time. It also dares you to grow because you learn a lot when reading, be it new vocabulary or new ideas, at the end of each reading session you come out more knowledgable than you were at the beginning of the session.</p>
            <p>Reading also helps us remember. Reading isn’t only about discovering the new. It’s also a vehicle for reflection. Many bibliophiles can trace their love of reading back to a cherished memory, such as being read to by a parent or discovering the first book they ever loved (Winnie the Pooh, Dr. Seuss or Enid Blyton). Re-reading those favorite books, or reading about familiar places, times and people helps us recall the details of our own lives. It reminds us who we are, where we are and how we came here.</p>

            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <h3>My Education</h3>
            <p>Education to me is the greatest investment. Education does not only come through the school system but also through reading books and different life experience. My interest is mainly in technology and that us why all the courses i have done are IT related. The schools I attended include:</p>
            <ol type="a">
                <li><strong>Riara University</strong> where I did a Diploma in Digital Marketing.</li>
                <li><strong>Strathmore University</strong> where I did a diploma in Business Information Technology</li>
                <li>Currently I am at <strong>Moringa School</strong> where i am doing Software Development</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Some of my favourite pastime include</p>
            <ul type="square">
                <li>Traveling</li>
                <li>Reading</li>
                <li>Cooking</li>
                <li>Watching documentaries</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="column">
                <h4>Travel</h4>
                <p>Travelling is such a great experience epecially when with friends and family. You get to experience different cultures, taste food from different places and make great memories. I think jet lag and tiredness of travelling is part of the charm. some of the benefits of traveling are improving health by cutting down stress, it makes you smarter by picki up new languages and traveling makes you feel like an adventurer.</p>

            <div class="column">
                <h4>Cooking</h4>
                <p>Cooking is important to me because it gives you a senese of independence. it might be a small task but everyone needs this skill to survive on their own. i like to cook mostly with my sisters because it is fun and we get to tell each other stories and formulate new recipies. This simple action helps us bond.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="column">
                <h4>Watching Documentaries</h4>
                <p>I developed an interest in documentaries when my dad used to request for documentaries and explain the stories being told. Now for me documentaries are a form of selfcare. The best kind of documentaries are mostly about war and serial killers. I would recommend The Vietnam War, Converrsations with a Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes, Night Stalker and Jeffery Epstein: Filthy Rich</p>
